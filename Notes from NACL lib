So,

we have a Zp = [0..p], where p = 2^255 - 19
We all agree on a g (9). I pick a j (secret key).

I calculate g^j and post it publicly (public key). 
Alice wants to *send* a message. She finds my g^j and chooses another k.
Alice computes g^j^k sets it as her key.
Alice sends g^k to me.
I receive alice's g^k, and combine it with my g^j to get: g^k^j

g^j^k = g^k^j, therefore we both have derived a secret
by only agreeing on 'g', publishing 'g^j' and sending 'g^k'


Box       => x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305
Uses peer public + my private to make a message only we can read
SecretBox => xsalsa20-poly1305
Just uses my private key. Only readable by key holders. Used with the shared key generated by x25519.
Signing   => Ed25519
Publicly readable data that is associated with my secret key
Hashing   => SHA-512
Getting a unique, fixed width value for arbitrary data
